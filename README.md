This game is our unique take on the classic Aesop Fable of The Lion & The Mouse. You play as the mouse and your goal is to not only survive the encounter with the lion but to save him in the end, after solving a puzzle. We decided to pick that topic because it was a simple enough story that we knew we could finish it in a week but also elaborate on it as much as we wanted because it was open to interpretation/changes.
