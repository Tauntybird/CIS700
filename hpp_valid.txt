At the beginning of the novel, Harry Potter is living in a cupboard under the stairs, suffering appalling maltreatment at the hands of the Dursley family, to whose care he was confided as an infant following the death of his parents; his mother was Mrs. Dursley’s sister. On his eleventh birthday, however, it is revealed to him, despite the Dursleys’ best efforts, that he has inherited magical abilities and is scheduled for education in wizardry at Hogwarts Academy, a key pillar of the British magical community, which lives in strict covert isolation from untalented “muggles.” This message is delivered by the intimidating Hagrid, who lives on the school grounds on the edge of a Forbidden Forest. Hagrid, who is fascinated by all manner of magical creatures, becomes Harry’s first fast friend.

Having obtained essential equipment from the magical mall in Diagon Alley, Harry catches the Hogwarts Express from platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross Station and is carried away to his new life. He finds that his reputation has preceded him to Hogwarts. While still preconscious in his cradle, he survived a magical assault by the infamous dark wizard Voldemort (whose name is so terrible in its effects that only Harry and Hogwarts’ headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, dare pronounce it), deflecting a killing spell back upon its sender and reducing Voldemort to helplessness. Despite the resentment generated by this reputation among the children of Voldemort’s former sympathizers—including fellow pupil Draco Malfoy and the disciplinarian teacher Severus Snape—Harry finds life at Hogwarts idyllic and makes two more firm friends in the bookish Hermione Granger and the hapless but willing Ron Weasley.

Initially, the only strong evidence of Harry’s talent is provided on the sports field, where he becomes an expert player of quidditch, a game played on flying broomsticks. Voldemort, however, is in hiding at Hogwarts, beginning to recover his powers and enthusiastic to get rid of his nemesis. Voldemort also wants to get hold of the philosopher’s stone, which was entrusted by the famous alchemist Nicholas Flamel to Dumbledore. With the aid of Hermione and Ron, and encouragement from Dumbledore and Hagrid, Harry contrives to thwart Voldemort’s ambition in a tense climax, but he realizes that he is engaged in a contest that is likely to be long and desperate.






The first of the "Harry Potter" books, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone introduces readers to Harry Potter on the cusp of his eleventh birthday. Born to a well-respected and much-loved witch and wizard, Harry Potter was orphaned as a baby and left to be taken care of by his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon Dursley, along with their son Dudley.

Harry bears the scars of his parents' fate and his orphaned status both literally and figuratively. The evil wizard Voldemort ("He Who Shall Not Be Named") killed Harry's parents but could not vanquish their son. As a result of the battle, Harry wears a curious, lightning-shaped scar on his forehead—a scar that burns when Harry is in danger or when he wakes up from a repeating nightmare of infant memory. Nevertheless, being the son of a successful magic couple and defeating an evil wizard as a one-year-old babe is not without benefits.






Heroic Harry Potter battles prejudice in the second volume of Rowling's wizard series. Returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry after another awful summer with his guardians, the Dursleys, twelve-year-old Harry yearns to play Quidditch, improve his magical skills, and enjoy his friendships. Such normal activities are soon overshadowed by sinister events. Prior to school beginning, a house elf named Dobby warned Harry not to go to Hogwarts and interfered with Harry's plans to do so.

At school, some students are targeted by malicious classmates and persecuted emotionally for not having pure wizard pedigrees. Several of these "mudbloods," as the students with non-wizard ancestors are called, are petrified by the idea of a monster that is rumored to live deep beneath the school in a secret chamber (reminding readers of the chambers Harry entered in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone). Only the heir of Hogwarts' founder Salazar Slytherin can open the secret chamber to release the malevolent creature held inside. While trying to solve the mystery, Harry is accused of being the heir because he is a Parseltongue who can communicate with snakes as Slytherin was able to do a thousand years earlier.

Misunderstood and concerned about the well-being of his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger in addition to his classmates, including Ron's younger sister Ginny who is held hostage in the chamber, Harry perseveres to save Hogwarts from destruction despite unfair allegations about his motives and character. He confronts his archenemy Lord Voldemort while questioning his own character and ancestry. Harry's self-confidence and faith in his allies bolster his magical abilities, allowing him to vanquish his foes in the form of the villainous Voldemort and his own confusing insecurities.







Having further penetrated the mysteries of Hogwarts Academy, where Voldemort had once been a pupil under the name of Tom Riddle in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry faces sterner challenges in his third year at the school. The infamous Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban—the magical prison to which Voldemort’s key supporters, the Death-Eaters, were sent when his first campaign was thwarted—and is rumored to be making his way to the school in order to kill Harry.

Harry begins to realize that the matter is more complicated when he has a terrifying encounter with a Dementor—one of the hideous, soul-sucking entities which guard the prison—on the Hogwarts Express. Even Dumbledore seems to doubt his testimony in this regard but is determined to keep him safe, with the aid of Remus Lupin, the new teacher of Defense Against the Dark Arts (a post with a remarkably high turnover). Harry has further trouble with both Severus Snape and Draco Malfoy, and his situation is further complicated when Hagrid becomes distraught after one of his unruly protégés, the hippogriff Buckbeak, is condemned to be put down.

It transpires that Sirius Black is actually Harry’s nearest living relative and staunchest defender, having once been part of a group of friends with Harry’s father and Remus Lupin, whose affliction with lycanthropy the group had striven to protect. The true enemy and cause of Harry’s troubles is, as always, Voldemort, who has subverted Azkaban and now has the Dementors at his beck and call. Harry is able to call upon the aid of the Marauder’s Map, which allows the locations of the academy’s inhabitants to be determined, as well as a time-bending watch, but he, Hermione, and Ron are tested to the limit of their strength and ingenuity by the quest to save Sirius and Buckbeak and to thwart Voldemort’s plans for a third time.






The third novel of Rowling's wizard saga revolves around themes of betrayal and forgiveness. Harry Potter realizes that people and creatures are often not who they appear to be, and those perceptions of friends and enemies are sometimes misleading. This novel's complex plot and themes symbolize teenaged Harry's maturation since the first Harry Potter book and reveal his increased self-confidence and control over his insecurities. In the beginning of the book, public hysteria over the escape of the notorious mass murderer Sirius Black from the wizard prison, Azkaban, results in heightened security at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry first hears of Black's escape while watching news with the Dursleys. He is upset when Vernon Dursley refuses to sign his permission slip to visit Hogsmeade, the magical village adjacent to Hogwarts that only third year students and older can roam, unless Harry acts appropriately, in Vernon's opinion, when his sister Marge visits. After an emotionally devastating encounter with Aunt Marge, Harry flees from his guardians' home.

Wandering the neighborhood, Harry is afraid that he will be banished from Hogwarts for using magic vengefully against Marge. He sees an alarming black dog and is rescued by the Knight Bus that deposits him at a boarding house called the Leaky Cauldron where he seeks sanctuary until school begins. While waiting for school to begin, Harry learns that the black dog he saw is a Grim, a death omen. His friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger eventually join Harry at the hotel. As the friends prepare to go back to school, Harry overhears Arthur and Molly Weasley discuss their fears that the fugitive Black will murder Harry because of comments that he reportedly muttered while sleeping in prison; they do not realize that Black is actually seeking Harry to protect him from the true culprit, Peter Pettigrew. Harry discovers that twelve years earlier Black was accused of betraying his parents whereabouts to Lord Voldemort thus exposing them to his murderous rage. Black was also blamed for killing thirteen Muggles with one curse.








Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is J. K. Rowling's fourth Harry Potter book in what is expected to be a series of seven. Like the books before it (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire opens during Harry's summer vacation from school. After the first few chapters, the reader returns to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with Harry and his two best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. It is at Hogwarts that the main action of the novel takes place. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire describes Harry's, Ron's, and Hermione's fourth year at Hogwarts, and by now we are not surprised to find it framed by the end of summer at the beginning of the novel and by the beginning of summer at the end of the novel. It is also not a surprise that, despite these frames, the bulk of the novel is devoted almost entirely to an academic setting.

And yet, there is a disappointment that familiarity can sometimes bring to readers desirous of new material and technique. Indeed, of Rowling's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, noted horror novelist Stephen King writes: "[We] may be a little tired of discovering Harry at home with his horrible aunt and uncle (plus his even more horrible cousin, Dudley, whose favorite PlayStation game is Mega-Mutilation Part 3), but once Harry has attended the obligatory Quidditch match and returned to Hogwarts, the tale picks up speed." While King has a point regarding the redundancy of the novel's frames, he is right in suggesting that "the tale picks up speed," for Rowling cannot be described as lacking in innovation(however loyal she is to the traditions of the fantasy genre). In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Rowling borrows the innovation of human development to keep her work strong. Earlier Harry Potter books use the Muggle (nonmagic) world as a backdrop for the magical world and a springboard for understanding and evaluating Hogwarts as a fantastic, parallel sociopolitical system. But this measure is no longer sufficient. Like the child-hero Harry (now 14 years old), the reader of J. K. Rowling's series craves to know more about the larger adult world that Harry will soon be entering.

For both protagonist and audience, and in keeping with classic British fantasy for young adults (especially the fantasy of C. S. Lewis), this larger world is the world of civil service and old school ties. It is the world of the Ministry of Magic and of adult characters more steeped in the recent history of the magic world—and all the policies, preferences, and politics that adult worlds involve.






Having confronted Voldemort in person for the first time at the end of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, unexpectedly surviving a second attempt to destroy him, Harry is in an awkward position at the beginning of the fifth volume in the series. The government of the hidden magical world, the Ministry of Magic, run by the bumbling Cornelius Fudge, refuses to admit that Voldemort is alive and has branded Harry a liar for asserting the opposite.

Harry’s adult supporters form the secret Order of the Phoenix to prepare for the impending war against Voldemort, but Harry’s safe refuge at Hogwarts is undermined when the ministry appoints one of its most officious bureaucrats, Dolores Umbridge, to overhaul its educational standards. Umbridge also turns out to be a sadist, inflicting painful punishments on Harry when he persists in his assertions.

When Defense Against the Dark Arts is dropped from the curriculum on Umbridge’s orders, Harry begins teaching the subject as best he can to a group of dissident students he calls Dumbledore’s Army. When his scheme is discovered and he is threatened with expulsion, this label enables Dumbledore to take responsibility instead. However, the headmaster’s subsequent sacking results in Umbridge being installed as High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, instituting a reign of persecution.

This time, Voldemort’s proximal target is not located at Hogarts but in the vaults of the Ministry of Magic, where a prophecy concerning his mysterious and potentially fatal relationship with Harry is secured. Hagrid’s crucial relationships with various fantastic creatures and his giant kinfolk prove crucial in permitting Harry, Hermione, and Ron to get out of Hogwarts in time to join the Order of the Phoenix in a pitched battle within the ministry. Although the Order of the Phoenix suffers serious fatalities, the ministry’s official position becomes untenable, and the battle against Voldemort becomes a matter of open warfare.






Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix opens with Harry Potter, a fifteen-year-old boy possessed with magical powers, spending another unhappy summer with his non-magical, or Muggle, guardians, the Dursleys. Still reeling from the previous school year's tragic events (chronicled in Rowling's fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ), Harry suffers recurring nightmares about his graveyard meeting with the dark Lord Voldemort where his friend Cedric was murdered. As a result of that encounter, Voldemort has now returned to bodily form, and Harry, with great anxiety, awaits news of the destruction Voldemort will inflict upon the wizardry and non-wizardry worlds. Harry finds there are no reports of unusual events despite his constant checking of the newspaper and television news, until one summer evening when he hears a sound that leads him to take a walk in the dark. Harry runs into his cousin Dudley while walking and as they taunt each other, two Dementors, the death-like, happiness-sucking prison guards from the wizardry world, attack the boys. Harry is able to fend them off with his sophisticated magic, only to find that he has been watched all summer by a neighbor as well as several incognito witches and wizards. Underage magic is banned in the Muggle world, thus Harry is threatened with expulsion from his wizardry boarding school, Hogwarts, and thrown out of his relatives' home for his defense against the Dementors.






The Minister of Magic visits the Muggle Prime Minister to inform him that Voldemort is back and wreaking havoc on the wizarding world and the Muggle world.

Meanwhile, Bellatrix and Narcissa visit Snape, imploring the professor to help Draco. Voldemort has given Draco an assignment and Narcissa is worried. Snape makes an Unbreakable Vow to watch over Draco and carry out Voldemort’s orders if Draco fails.

At the Weasleys, Harry arrives and learns that Bill and Fleur Delacour are engaged. Harry, Hermione, and Ron receive their O.W.L. (Ordinary Wizarding Levels) test scores. Harry failed Divination and History of Magic, but did well in everything else.

Harry receives news that he is the new Quidditch Captain. The friends head to Diagon Alley, which is more empty than usual because people are afraid. They go to Fred and George’s joke shop, which is thriving despite the depression in Diagon Alley. Harry spots Draco Malfoy outside, and follows Draco to Borgin and Burkes, a store that sells Dark Arts objects. Draco asks the proprietor to keep something for him and repair it.

Afterward, Harry sneaks into Slytherin’s train compartment to spy on Draco, and hears Draco bragging about moving on to better things. As everyone disembarks, Draco catches Harry, paralyzing him with magic, breaks Harry’s nose, and throws the invisibility cloak over him and leaves him there.

Luckily, Tonks discovers and frees him. She is stationed near the school as security. At the gate, Snape walks him back to the school, berating him for his tardiness.

Dumbledore announces a new Potions teacher, Horace Slughorn. To everyone’s shock, Snape has been appointed the  Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

In Potions, Slughorn has them mix up a “Draught of the Living Death.” Harry makes the best potion by following handwritten directions in his textbook, and wins a luck potion. He finds “This book is property of the Half-Blood Prince” written in the book.

Harry starts private lessons with Dumbledore. At his first lesson, they use the Pensieve to visit memories that will help Harry survive. They witness Voldemort’s mother, Merope, who was part of a violent, unstable wizarding family, the Gaunts. Merope uses a love potion to marry Tom Riddle, Sr., later bearing his child. However, Tom leaves her and the child when the potion wears off.

Harry holds Quidditch tryouts. Ron narrowly wins Keeper position over a boy named Cormac McLaggen, who is angry he has not made the team.

During a trip into Hogsmeade, the friends witness Katie Bell become cursed from handling a Dark necklace from Borgin and Burkes. Her friend says she was going to deliver it to someone at Hogwarts.

At Harry's next lesson with Dumbledore, they look at a memory of young Tom Riddle. Tom has strong powers and uses them to hurt others. Even as a child, Tom had already begun to become Voldemort.

At the first Quidditch match, Ron is nervous so Harry makes him believe he has slipped him the luck potion. Gryffindor wins! Afterwards, Ron kisses Lavender Brown and Hermione becomes jealous. Harry realizes that he has feelings for Ginny.

At Slughorn’s party, Harry is accosted by Slughorn, who wants an author friend of his to write Harry’s biography. Malfoy crashes the party and Snape is angry. Harry overhears Snapeoffering to help Draco with his. Harry learns that Snape has made an Unbreakable Vow to protect Draco.

At Harry’s next lesson with Dumbledore, they enter the memory of a teenage Tom. Tom visits his Gaunt relatives and discovers his parentage. He steals his uncle Morphin’s wand and kills Tom Riddle, Sr., and erases Morphin’s memory. Morphin dies in Azkaban for the crime. They also look at a memory in which Tom asks Slughorn about Horcruxes. Slughorn has tampered with the memory and his answer has been erased. Dumbledore tells Harry it is his mission to recover the truth.

Harry asks Slughorn about Horcruxes and Slughorn becomes upset, avoiding Harry. 






Following another deeply troubled year at Hogwarts, described in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, at the end of which Dumbledore is killed by the ever-deceptive Severus Snape, Harry begins the final volume of the series in hiding. When the spell that has kept him safe until his seventeenth birthday expires, he and his helpers are immediately attacked by Voldemort, suffering casualties.

Unable to return to Hogwarts, Harry is forced to go on the run with Ron and Hermione, hunting desperately for the “horcruxes” that contain fragments of Voldemort’s soul and thus maintain his invulnerability. The search for the horcruxes is complicated when Harry learns of the existence of another set of magical objects—the “deathly hallows”—which might also be vital to the settlement of the final battle. Voldemort is unable to give his complete attention to the quest to kill Harry because he is searching for one of the hallows: an undefeatable wand.

Uncertain as to whether to give priority to the remaining horcruxes or the hallows, Harry continues to evade death, albeit narrowly, until he is forced to return to Hogwarts in order to complete his search. The castle housing Hogwarts Academy then becomes the last fortress holding out against Voldemort’s rise to power, subject to intensive siege and violent bombardment.

The remnants of Dumbledore’s Army and the Order of the Phoenix mount a heroic defense of Hogwarts in the attempt to win Harry enough time to finish his quest, suffering heavy casualties in the process. The conflict reaches the limit of desperation when it becomes evident that Harry harbors one of the fragments of Voldemort’s soul in his own flesh. It appears that Harry cannot kill his enemy without sacrificing himself in the process, but that sacrifice might also make Voldemort invincible.
